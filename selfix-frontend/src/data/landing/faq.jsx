    question: "What is 'entropy' in the context of cybersecurity?",
    answer: "Entropy refers to the gradual degradation, instability, or decay of software and system configurations over time. This 'digital rust' increases vulnerability to threats. SELFIX actively monitors and heals entropy to prevent breaches before they happen."
  },
  {
    question: "Can SELFIX work completely offline?",
    answer: "Yes, SELFIX's core AI healing engine is designed to run locally on the endpoint. It can detect and neutralize threats even without an active internet connection. However, internet access is required for license validation, module updates, and HQ escalation."
  },
  {
    question: "What exactly happens in Quarantine mode?",
    answer: "Quarantine mode is an elevated security state triggered by severe threats. The affected endpoint is isolated from the network to prevent lateral movement. SELFIX attempts localized containment while alerting administrators and potentially escalating to our HQ for expert review. Users may have limited functionality until the threat is resolved."

    question: "How does SmartLicense-X™ actually work?",
    answer: "SmartLicense-X™ is our proprietary legal-computational framework that embeds ethical rules and usage rights directly into the software's code. It ensures compliance and can programmatically enforce terms, adding a layer of verifiable trust and transparency to our services that traditional EULAs cannot."
